# Rock, Paper, Scissors Game

This is a simple **Rock, Paper, Scissors** game written in Python. The user plays against the computer, which randomly selects one of the three choices. The game continues until the user decides to quit.

# How the Game Works?

The user chooses between "rock", "paper", or "scissors".
The computer randomly selects a choice.
The game compares the player's choice with the computer's choice to determine the winner:
  ""Rock beats Scissors**

  ""Paper beats Rock""
 If both the player and the computer choose the same option, it's a tie.
 The game will continue until the user types "quit".
